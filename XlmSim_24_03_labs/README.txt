This is the README file for:

        XCELIUM 24.03

The software products and versions required for this course are:

->  XCELIUM24.03

Although you can expect the Cadence software to run on any platform
Cadence supports, the database is tested only with version XCELIUM23.09 on:
        LINUX RHEL 7
        LINUX CentOS 7.4
        LINUX RHEL 8
        LINUX SLES 15   

The lab database is not tested on any other platform or tool version.
The lab database is not tested on AIX because we do not support gcc on AIX.

//Before you run any Cadence software, verify your patch level with
//"checkSysConf XCELIUM2309 " and install any missing required patches.

Make sure that you have the Xcleium 23.09 veriosn somewhere in your cshrc or
the environemnt setup script.

To cofirm this execute the following command:

which xrun

This should show the entire path pointing to the 24.03 Xcelium tool installation path.
